= Factory Functions

Factory Functions are a special collection of functions that return an instance of a class.

All factory functions are methods of the `GDS` class. 
You can call a factory function after instantiating a TigerGraph Connection. 
For example:

[,python]
----
conn = TigerGraphConnection(
    host="http://127.0.0.1", 
    graphname="Cora",
    username="tigergraph",
    password="tigergraph",
    useCert=False
)
edge_loader = conn.gds.edgeLoader(
    num_batches=1,
    attributes=["time", "is_train"])
----

The object returned has access to instance methods of the class. 
You can find the reference for those classes on the following pages:

* link:https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/current/gds/dataloaders[Data loaders]
* link:https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/current/gds/featurizer[Featurizer]
* link:https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/current/gds/metrics[Metrics]
* link:https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/current/gds/dataloaders[Splitters]

NOTE: If you are not sure how to configure the optional arguments related to Kafka, leave them blank. 
More detailed instructions on how to use them will be provided in a future release. 

== neighborLoader()
`neighborLoader(v_in_feats: Union[list, dict] = None, v_out_labels: Union[list, dict] = None, v_extra_feats: Union[list, dict] = None, e_in_feats: Union[list, dict] = None, e_out_labels: Union[list, dict] = None, e_extra_feats: Union[list, dict] = None, batch_size: int = None, num_batches: int = 1, num_neighbors: int = 10, num_hops: int = 2, shuffle: bool = False, filter_by: str = None, output_format: str = "PyG", add_self_loop: bool = False, loader_id: str = None, buffer_size: int = 4, kafka_address: str = None, kafka_max_msg_size: int = 104857600, kafka_num_partitions: int = 1, kafka_replica_factor: int = 1, kafka_retention_ms: int = 60000, kafka_auto_del_topic: bool = True, kafka_address_consumer: str = None, kafka_address_producer: str = None, timeout: int = 300000) -> NeighborLoader`

Returns a `NeighborLoader` instance.
A `NeighborLoader` instance performs neighbor sampling from all vertices in the graph in batches in the following manner:

. It chooses a specified number (`batch_size`) of vertices as seeds. 
The number of batches is the total number of vertices divided by the batch size. 
* If you specify the number of batches (`num_batches`) instead, `batch_size` is calculated by dividing the total number of vertices by the number of batches.
If specify both parameters, `batch_size` takes priority. 
. It picks a specified number (`num_neighbors`) of neighbors of each seed at random.
. It picks the same number of neighbors for each neighbor, and repeats this process until it finished performing a specified number of hops (`num_hops`).

This generates one subgraph. 
As you loop through this data loader, every vertex will at some point be chosen as a seed and you will get the subgraph
expanded from the seeds. 
If you want to limit seeds to certain vertices, the boolean
attribute provided to `filter_by` will be used to indicate which vertices can be
included as seeds.

NOTE: When you initialize the loader on a graph for the first time,
the initialization might take a minute as it installs the corresponding
query to the database. However, the query installation only
needs to be done once, so it will take no time when you initialize the loader
on the same graph again.

See https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/mlworkbench-docs/blob/1.0/tutorials/basics/3_neighborloader.ipynb[the ML Workbench tutorial notebook]
for examples.

== edgeLoader()
`edgeLoader(attributes: Union[list, dict] = None, batch_size: int = None, num_batches: int = 1, shuffle: bool = False, filter_by: str = None, output_format: str = "dataframe", loader_id: str = None, buffer_size: int = 4, kafka_address: str = None, kafka_max_msg_size: int = 104857600, kafka_num_partitions: int = 1, kafka_replica_factor: int = 1, kafka_retention_ms: int = 60000, kafka_auto_del_topic: bool = True, kafka_address_consumer: str = None, kafka_address_producer: str = None, timeout: int = 300000) -> EdgeLoader`

Returns an `EdgeLoader` instance. 
An `EdgeLoader` instance loads all edges in the graph in batches.

It divides all edges into `num_batches` and returns each batch separately.
You can also specify the size of each batch, and the number of batched is calculated accordingly. 
If you provide both parameters, `batch_size` take priority. 
The boolean attribute provided to `filter_by` indicates which edges are included.
If you need random batches, set `shuffle` to True.

NOTE: When you initialize the loader on a graph for the first time,
the initialization might take a minute as it installs the corresponding
query to the database. However, the query installation only
needs to be done once, so it will take no time when you initialize the loader
on the same graph again.

There are two ways to use the data loader.

* It can be used as an iterable, which means you can loop through
it to get every batch of data. If you load all edges at once (`num_batches=1`),
there will be only one batch (of all the edges) in the iterator.
* You can access the `data` property of the class directly. If there is
only one batch of data to load, it will give you the batch directly instead
of an iterator. If there are
multiple batches of data to load, it returns the loader itself.

Returns a `GraphLoader`instance.

the initialization might take a minute as it installs the corresponding
query to the database. However, the query installation only
