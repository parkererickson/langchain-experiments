= NodePiece Transforms

== NodePieceMLPTransform
The NodePieceMLPTransform converts a batch of data from the NodePieceLoader into a format that can be used in a MLP implemented in PyTorch.


=== \__init__()
`__init__(label: str, features: list, target_type: str = None)`

Instantiate a NodePieceMLPTransform.
[discrete]
==== Parameters:
label (str): 
The attribute name that corresponds with the label being predicted. Supports numerical datatypes (INT, FLOAT, DOUBLE).
* `features (list of str, optional)`: List of attributes to use as features into the model. Supports numerical datatypes (INT, FLOAT, DOUBLE).
* `target_type (str, optional)`: The type of vertex to perform predictions on.


=== __call__()
`__call__(data)`

Perform the transform.
[discrete]
==== Parameter:
* `data (pd.DataFrame)`: Batch of data produced by the NodePiece Loader.
